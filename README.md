In this project, I've developed a dashboard utilizing Plotly python repo and Dash Framework. I've integrated Mapbox API for visualizing geospatial data of Ireland Accommodations. This app includes features as follows:
1.	Filtering based on Ireland Regions and ratings of accommodations.
2.	A stacked bar chart showing a total of each type of accommodations against each region.
3.	A map of Ireland showing all the accommodations through a scatter plot implemented on Mapbox.
4.	A click-event for each data point on the map that leads to the specific website for that accommodation.
